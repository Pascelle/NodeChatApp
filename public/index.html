 	<!-- below: this script loads a method that allows us to initiate a connection request -->
 	<script>
 		var socket = io();
 		//available to us bc we loaded in socket.io.  When we call it we are innitiating the request from the client to the server to open up a web socket and keep that connection open.   What we gets back from io() is important and should be stored in a var.  var socket allows us to listen for data from the server and send data to the server.

 		socket.on('connect', () => {
 			//we don't get a socket argument here bc we already have it above
 			console.log('Connected to server')
 		});

 		socket.on('disconnect', () => {
 			console.log('disconnected from server');
 		});
